**Features**

* when you close it, it simply encrypts to a file whatever text you type in
the editor, also making a backup.

* uses Rijndael and SHA512 for encryption. It's done based on a password
of your choice.

It's taylored to my own needs, modify it to suit your own. I'm not a professional programmer,
so this isn't the best code you'll find on the web, you have been warned :-))

All the bugs are guaranteed to be genuine, and are exclusively mine =)
